Homebase - AI-Powered Real Estate Investment Platform

PROBLEM
Individual real estate investors struggle to compete with institutional players. They lack access to comprehensive market data, AI-driven insights, and efficient deal sourcing tools. Traditional real estate investment requires significant manual research, taking 40+ hours per property evaluation.

SOLUTION
Homebase is a B2B SaaS platform that democratizes real estate investment intelligence. We use AI and machine learning to analyze millions of property records, market trends, and neighborhood data to provide institutional-grade insights to individual investors and small investment firms.

Our platform enables investors to:
- Discover undervalued properties using predictive analytics
- Evaluate investment potential with AI-powered cash flow modeling
- Access real-time market comparables and rental yield predictions
- Automate due diligence workflows
- Connect with vetted contractors and property managers

PRODUCT
Our proprietary algorithm analyzes 50+ data points per property including:
- Historical price trends and appreciation rates
- Demographic shifts and economic indicators
- School ratings, crime statistics, and infrastructure developments
- Rental market demand and vacancy rates
- Property condition estimates using computer vision

The platform delivers investment scores, ROI projections, and actionable recommendations in under 60 seconds per property.
