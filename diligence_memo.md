# Financial Diligence Memo: Seed-stage B2B SaaS

## Summary
- Burn is materially above seed B2B SaaS norms; runway is near the target but not generous enough to derisk an 18‑month $150K MRR push without additional capital or operating changes.
- Operating leverage is implied to be low (likely high burn per head) vs seed B2B SaaS benchmarks.
- Path to milestone is possible but high risk; requires disciplined expense control and early revenue traction.

### Bottom line
- Proceed with caution; propose a smaller initial commitment contingent on operating plan updates and evidence of early revenue conversion.

## 1) Burn assessment
- Current monthly burn: ~$228K.  
- Seed B2B SaaS benchmark range: $60K–$120K.  
- Status: 1.9–3.8x above the upper bound.  
- Takeaway: Burn intensity significantly exceeds typical seed norms, implying either headcount scale-up or spend on GTM/infra ahead of traction.

## 2) Runway adequacy
- Base-case runway: ~15.0 months.  
- Downside-case runway: ~12.5 months.  
- Target runway: ~12 months.  
- Assessment: Slightly above target in base case; however, insufficient buffer for an 18‑month $150K MRR plan unless revenue ramps faster than burn. Downside-case runway falls short of seed norms.

## 3) Capital efficiency (burn per employee)
- Implied burn per employee (15.0-month runway, $228K burn): ~$3.42M/head/year.  
- Seed B2B SaaS benchmark: ~$150K/head/year.  
- Status: ~22.8x above benchmark; likely driven by outsized spend (sales/marketing, contractors, or infra) and/or smaller headcount with high fixed burn.  
- Red flag: High burn/head suggests limited operating leverage; prioritize reducing discretionary spend and improving unit economics before scale.

## 4) Milestone alignment
- Milestone: $150K MRR within 18 months and reach profitability breakeven.  
- Scenario view (monthly net burn / implied ARR potential if at break-even):
  - Base-case (15.0 months runway): ~$2.74M MRR implied if break-even reached at runway end; needs a 2.7x reduction in net burn to achieve breakeven.
  - Downside-case (12.5 months runway): ~$3.29M MRR implied; requires a 3.3x reduction in net burn to achieve breakeven.
- Assessment: While not impossible, reaching $150K MRR and breakeven within 18 months is high risk with current burn profile and runway. Early, defensible pipeline and strong gross margin (typical 70–80% for SaaS) are prerequisites; otherwise, staged capital with clear CAC/LTV milestones is advisable.

## Key risks and mitigation
- High burn vs benchmarks: Tighten GTM spend, defer non-essential hires, optimize infra and tooling; target mid-range burn (~$100K/month).
- Low implied operating leverage: Track headcount/ARR ratio; enforce hiring gates linked to validated pipeline and revenue conversion.
- Runway vs 18‑month plan: Require 12–18 months runway for the full milestone window; if not, propose a convertible note with pro‑rata rights to bridge if interim milestones are hit.

## Investor conditions to consider
- Clarify business model fit: Company is B2B SaaS, but listed competitors are primarily real estate marketplaces (Roofstock, Arrived Homes, Fundrise, Zillow, Redfin). Validate product and market (B2B SaaS) alignment.
- Updated metrics: Current headcount and gross margin; ARR/MRR; sales cycle and CAC/LTV.
- Operating plan: Path to reduce monthly burn to ≤$120K within 90 days and to breakeven by the 18‑month mark; milestone-based capital tranches (e.g., seed round contingent on reaching $50K MRR and sustaining ≤$120K burn).
- Runway target: Maintain ≥15 months runway post-financing or adjust milestones accordingly.

## Decision
- Lean no without plan refinements; lean yes if founders commit to an expense reset (≤$120K monthly burn), provide CAC/LTV and pipeline evidence, and agree to milestone-based financing with pro‑rata rights.
